### Useful resources

- [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KEpWHtG10M&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gjxLvV4VEkZ6H6H4yWuS58) - This helped me to learn about Material UI and how to use it to create greate-looking React applications.
- [CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/)

### What I learned

I used Material-UI for the first time in this challenge. In particular, I applied to components using global theme creation and customized styles. As it was the first time, I was not familiar with how to use it, so I struggled despite the easy challenge, but it was a good opportunity to learn about Material-UI.
